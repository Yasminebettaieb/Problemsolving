**This is a solution For a problem "Polygon"**
[->Link to problem in codeforces <-](https://codeforces.com/contest/166/problem/B)


**Resume of this problem:**
task is to check whether polygon B is positioned strictly inside polygon A. 
It means that any point of polygon B should be strictly inside polygon A. "Strictly" means that the vertex of polygon _B_ cannot lie on the side of the polygon A.
